The HMI Configurator may be started from the Start Menu. 
It may also be started from the command line using the -hmi-editor option, 
which should be used as the first option:

    <glg_dir>\DEMOS\main_demo\GlgDemo.exe -hmi-editor [other_options]

Shortcuts for starting the HMI Configurator with the GDI or OpenGL driver
